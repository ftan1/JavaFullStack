# **Rewards Program API**

This project is a Spring Boot-based web application that provides an API to calculate rewards points for customers based on their transactions. MongoDB is used as the database to store the transaction details. Customers are awarded points based on the amount spent in each transaction:
- 2 points for every dollar spent over $100.
- 1 point for every dollar spent between $50 and $100.

- **MongoDB** (Database)
- **Java 17**
- **Spring Data MongoDB**
- **Maven** (Build Tool)
- **Postman** (API Testing)

---

## **Setup Instructions**

### 1. **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/rewards-program-api.git
cd rewards-program-api
```

### 2. **Prerequisites**
- **Java 17** or higher installed.
- **MongoDB** installed and running locally or through Docker.
- **Maven** installed.

### 3. **Configure MongoDB Connection**
In the `src/main/resources/application.properties` file, ensure the MongoDB connection string is properly set:
```properties
spring.data.mongodb.uri=mongodb://localhost:27017/rewardsdb
```

If MongoDB is running on a different host or port, update the URI accordingly.

### 4. **Install Dependencies**
To install all necessary dependencies, run:
```bash
mvn clean install
```

### 5. **Run the Application**
Once dependencies are installed, you can start the application by running:
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```
The application will start on `http://localhost:8080`.

---

## **Running the Application**

After starting the application, you can interact with the API using tools like Postman or cURL.

Ensure that MongoDB is running before starting the application. If MongoDB is not running, start it with:

```bash
mongod --dbpath <path_to_your_data_directory>
```

Alternatively, if using Docker, start MongoDB using Docker with:
```bash
docker run -d -p 27017:27017 --name mongodb mongo:latest
```

  GET http://localhost:8080/api/rewards/1/monthly?month=8&year=2024
  ```
- **Response**:
  ```json
  {
    "points": 120
  }
  ```

### 2. **Get Total Reward Points for a Customer**
- **Description**: Fetch the total reward points earned by a customer across all transactions.
- **URL**: `/api/rewards/{customerId}/total`
- **Method**: `GET`
- **Parameters**: 
  - `customerId`: The ID of the customer (path variable).
- **Example**:

## **Database**

This application uses **MongoDB** as its database. All transaction records are stored in a MongoDB collection called `transactions`. 

### **Sample MongoDB Document**:
```json
{
  "_id": "someMongoId",
  "customerId": 1,
  "amount": 120.0,
  "date": "2024-08-01"
}
```

---

## **Testing**

You can test the API using **Postman** or **cURL**.

### **Sample cURL Commands**:

1. **Get Monthly Rewards**:
   ```bash
   curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/api/rewards/1/monthly?month=8&year=2024"
   ```

2. **Get Total Rewards**:
   ```bash
   curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/api/rewards/1/total"
   ```

3. **Get All Customers**:
   ```bash
   curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/api/rewards/customers"
   ```

---

## **Notes**
- Make sure MongoDB is running before starting the application.
- You can modify the `application.properties` file to change the MongoDB connection settings.
- Data is cleared and inserted during application startup for testing purposes. This behavior can be modified in the `DataLoader` class.
